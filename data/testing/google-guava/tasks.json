(Consistency might help the snapshot docs in search-engine ratings, as touched upon in discussions of `<link rel=\"canonical\" ...>` in b/69667335 and https://github.com/google/guava/issues/7597.)\n- Link to JDK 25 and Guava's head/snapshot docs.\n  - But continue to link to JDK 7 for a few `Forwarding*` classes that specifically want to show which methods existed at that point.\n  - And continue to link to earlier JDKs when I couldn't easily find equivalents in newer JDKs' docs, like for assertions and try-with-resources (though I was still sometimes able to bump the version slightly, like from 7 to 8 for spurious wakeups and multicatch).\n  - But I did find equivalents for various docs (e.g., jar spec, crypto spec, serialization spec), albeit with rather different URLs.\n  - In one Google-internal class, I noticed that the newer JLS has a section title that doesn't match the old section title, so I changed the link text to match the new title.\n  - In `ImmutableCollection`, I noticed that the relevant link to `Set` needed to change from `#immutable` to `#unmodifiable`.\n- Use `#foo(A,B)` instead of `#foo-A-B-`, as required by modern Javadoc.\n  - I also noticed one appearance of a stray `%20` (in \"Object common methods\"), which I removed.\n  - In `MacHashFunctionTest`, I added the new link but kept the old one in place, since the old one matches the list in the source code. Possibly we should update the source code to match the new list.\n- Update a couple Spring links in the EventBus `README`.\n- Fix a wiki link about range-check elimination in `Utf8`.\n\nOne thing that did **not** do was change links to point to shortlinks like guava.dev/ImmutableList.

  "problem_statement" : "Make `UnsafeComparator` class initialization succeed even in cases in which we can't use that comparator.\n\nMake `UnsafeComparator` class initialization succeed even in cases in which we can't use that comparator.\n\nThis accommodates some apps that eagerly initialize internal Guava classes that they've seen used in previous runs. Currently, such apps crash when `UnsafeComparator` fails to initialize, either because of `--sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=deny` or because of `-XX:+UseCompactObjectHeaders`. This CL makes the class initialization succeed, setting a flag to indicate whether we should actually use the resulting comparator.\n\nReally, failing class initialization has always been a gross way to operate. Concretely, we've seen similar tricks cause log spam on Android (https://github.com/google/guava/commit/fb109b051c9ec48d5e77bf73b33a228ab5d57462). (Granted, we'd expect `Unsafe` to remain available for a long time under Android, so we shouldn't see that kind of issue here—at least not unless optimizers like Proguard are removing `UnsafeComparator`, in which case we'd rather make them stop doing that, rather than silence the warning as we do here....)\n\nI also found it convenient to eliminate an `unchecked` warning as part of introducing `interface LexicographicalComparator`, and I suppressed some `deprecation` warnings for `Unsafe`.\n\nFinally, I belatedly updated some documentation that was still suggesting that `Unsafe` was our preferred implementation in all environments.\n\nRELNOTES=n/a\n",

  "problem_statement" : "Avoid setting `final` fields in `ConcurrentHashMultiset` deserialization.\n\nAvoid setting `final` fields in `ConcurrentHashMultiset` deserialization.\n\nThis covers the first class from https://github.com/google/guava/issues/8099.\n\nAs part of doing that, I needed a way to create a new `ConcurrentHashMap` instances without failing the existing `countMap.isEmpty()` check in the constructor. To do that, I moved the check out of the constructor and into the `create(ConcurrentMap)` static factory method. Then I updated all existing users of the constructor to instead call `create(ConcurrentMap)`.\n\nAlong the way, I noticed that we'd never removed a TODO about exposing `create(ConcurrentMap)` in the first place, so I removed that.\n\nPlus:\n\n- I updated the comment about why we override `toArray`. (Spoiler: We probably shouldn't override one of the two overloads anymore.) I also tweaked the name of a helper method.\n- I added `@Serial` annotations to our serialization-related methods, and I removed one such method's `@J2ktIncompatible` annotation, which was unnecessary because the entire class is `@J2ktIncompatible`.\n- other tiny tweaks, including in tests\n\n(Fun fact: Back when I was discussing with Gemini the alternative of switching to using default serialization, it noticed the existing incorrect type for `deserializedCountMap`. back then, the type was worth fixing just to be pedantic, but now it actually matters.)\n\nRELNOTES=`collect`: Changed `ConcurrentHashMultiset` deserialization to [avoid mutating `final` fields](https://openjdk.org/jeps/500). In extremely unlikely scenarios in which an instance of that type contains an object that refers back to that instance, this could lead to [a broken instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/specs/serialization/input.html#the-readresolve-method:~:text=in%20cases%20where%20an%20object%20being%20serialized%20nominates%20a%20replacement%20object%20whose%20object%20graph%20has%20a%20reference%20to%20the%20original%20object) that throws `NullPointerException` when used.\n",
